# 🏥 Hospital Equity in the U.S.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between hospital characteristics and equity performance across the United States using data from the **Lown Institute Hospital Index, 2022**.

## 🔍 Project Question

## 🎯 Goals
- Visualize the geographic distribution of hospital equity, the most equitable hospitals defined as having recieving an equity grade of A or B.
- Identify patterns between hospital size (xs-xl) and equity scores to understand how physical differences may affect equitable care delivery.
- Suggest actionable insights that can inform where improvements are needed.
