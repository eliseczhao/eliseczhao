# 🏥 Hospital Equity in the U.S.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the **Lown Hospital Index for Equity 2022** to examine whether a hospital's size or ownership type is associated with its equity performance.

## 🔍 Project Question
**Is there a relationship between a hospital’s size or ownership type and its equity grade?**

## 🎯 Goals
- Evaluate the relationship between hospital size (xs-l) and equity scores to assess whether larger or smaller institutions perform differently in serving diverse or underserved communities.
- Identify patterns between hospital ownership type (nonprofit, for-profit, government) and equity scores to understand how structural differences may affect equitable care delivery.
- Suggest actionable insights that can inform healthcare administrators, policymakers, or advocacy groups on how institutional characteristics may impact equity—and where improvements are needed.
